### What is Squealer?
Squealer is a project divided in 3 separate apps. The main app is a Social Network where a user can post in different channels, private or public.

The moderator dashboard lets a moderator manage channels, posts and users. The moderator can edit post reactions, channel properties and user properties.

The Social Media Manager dashboard app makes an SMM manage different user accounts. The SMM can post on behalf of their clients and see which posts are performing the best/worst.
